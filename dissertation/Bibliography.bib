abstract = "The Hough transform is recognized as being a powerful tool in shape analysis which gives good results even in the presence of noise and occlusion. Major shortcomings of the technique are excessive storage requirements and computational complexity. Solutions to these problems form the bulk of contributions to the literature concerning the Hough transform. An excellent comprehensive review of available methods up to and partially including 1988 is given by Illingworth and Kittler (Comput. Vision Graphics Image Process. 44, 1988, 87-116). In the years following this survey much new literature has been published. The present work offers an update on state of the art Hough techniques. This includes comparative studies of existing techniques, new perspectives on the theory, very many novel algorithms, parallel implementations, and additions to the task-specific hardware. Care is taken to distinguish between research that aims to further basic understanding of the technique without necessarily being computationally realistic and research that may be applicable in an industrial context. A new trend in Hough transform work, that of the probabilistic Houghs, is identified and reviewed in some detail. Attempts to link the low level perceptive processing offered by the Hough transform to high level knowledge driven processing are also included, together with the many recent successful applications appearing in the literature."
