\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
A special thank you to the Charlotte and Julian from the Lovelace lab, without whom it would not have been possible to use the university's laser cutter.
\\\\
Also, a kind thank you to my project supervisor, Christian Richardt, for advice and support throughout.
\\\\
I would also like to mention my grandfather, John Reeves, for financial support and my close family for moral support throughout my time at the University of Bath.
