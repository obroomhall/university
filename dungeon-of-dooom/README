The number of players that can join the game is
only limited by the size of the maze.

Server, Client and Bot can all connect to a
 different port specified at command line.

Server must be running for clients to connect.
 The server will end the game and close when all
 clients have left the server.

If the map is not chosen by the server before
 clients connect, clients can send commands that
 will run when the map is chosen.
 
Clients can exit with ^C or QUIT and the server
 cleanly remove them from the game.
